# T1587.002 - Code Signing Certificates
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1587/002)
<blockquote>Adversaries may create self-signed code signing certificates that can be used during targeting. Code signing is the process of digitally signing executables and scripts to confirm the software author and guarantee that the code has not been altered or corrupted. Code signing provides a level of authenticity for a program from the developer and a guarantee that the program has not been tampered with.(Citation: Wikipedia Code Signing) Users and/or security tools may trust a signed piece of code more than an unsigned piece of code even if they don't know who issued the certificate or who the author is.

Prior to [Code Signing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1553/002), adversaries may develop self-signed code signing certificates for use in operations.</blockquote>

## Atomic Tests

- [Atomic Test #1 - Add Root Certificate to CurrentUser Certificate Store](#atomic-test-1---add-root-certificate-to-currentuser-certificate-store)


<br/>

## Atomic Test #1 - Add Root Certificate to CurrentUser Certificate Store
The following Atomic test simulates adding a generic non-malicious certificate to the CurrentUser certificate store. This behavior generates a registry modification that adds the cloned root CA certificate in the keys outlined in the blog.
Keys will look like - \SystemCertificates\CA\Certificates or \SystemCertificates\Root\Certificates
