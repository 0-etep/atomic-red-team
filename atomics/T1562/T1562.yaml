    The following Atomic adds a registry entry to disable LSA Protection.

    The LSA controls and manages user rights information, password hashes and other important bits of information in memory. Attacker tools, such as mimikatz, rely on accessing this content to scrape password hashes or clear-text passwords. Enabling LSA Protection configures Windows to control the information stored in memory in a more secure fashion - specifically, to prevent non-protected processes from accessing that data.
    Upon successful execution, the registry will be modified and RunAsPPL will be set to 0, disabling Lsass protection.

    The atomic test disables the journal logging using built-in systemctl utility

  - linux
  executor:
    command: |
     sudo systemctl stop systemd-journald #disables journal logging
    name: sh
    elevation_required: true
- name: Disable journal logging via journald.conf
  description: |
    The atomic test diables the journal logging by searching and replacing the "Storage" parameter to "none" within the journald.conf file, thus any new journal entries will only be temporarily available in memory and not written to disk
  supported_platforms:
  - linux
  executor:
    command: |
     sudo sed -i 's/Storage=auto/Storage=none/' /etc/systemd/journald.conf
