# T1123 - Audio Capture Mitigation
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1123)
Mitigating this technique specifically may be difficult as it requires fine-grained API control. Efforts should be focused on preventing unwanted or unknown code from executing on a system.

Identify and block potentially malicious software that may be used to record audio by using whitelisting (Citation: Beechey 2010) tools, like AppLocker, (Citation: Windows Commands JPCERT) (Citation: NSA MS AppLocker) or Software Restriction Policies (Citation: Corio 2008) where appropriate. (Citation: TechNet Applocker vs SRP)

## Atomic Test #1 - SourceRecorder via Windows command prompt
Create a file called test.wma, with the duration of 30 seconds

**Supported Platforms:** windows


#### Inputs
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|-------------------------------------------|
    | output_file | Path to the recording file being captured | Path | test.wma|
    | duration_hms | Duration of audio to be recorded (in h:m:s format) | Path | 30|

#### Run it with `command_prompt`!
```
SoundRecorder /FILE #{output_file} /DURATION #{duration_hms}

```
