# T1099 - Timestomp Mitigation
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1099)
Mitigation of timestomping specifically is likely difficult. Efforts should be focused on preventing potentially malicious software from running. Identify and block potentially malicious software that may contain functionality to perform timestomping by using whitelisting (Citation: Beechey 2010) tools like AppLocker (Citation: Windows Commands JPCERT) (Citation: NSA MS AppLocker) or Software Restriction Policies (Citation: Corio 2008) where appropriate. (Citation: TechNet Applocker vs SRP)

## Atomic Tests

- [Atomic Test #1 - Set a file's access timestamp](#atomic-test-1---set-a-files-access-timestamp)

- [Atomic Test #2 - Set a file's modification timestamp](#atomic-test-2---set-a-files-modification-timestamp)

- [Atomic Test #3 - Set a file's creation timestamp](#atomic-test-3---set-a-files-creation-timestamp)


<br/>

## Atomic Test #1 - Set a file's access timestamp
Stomps on the access timestamp of a file

**Supported Platforms:** linux, macos


#### Inputs
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|-------------------------------------------|
    | target_filename | Path of file that we are going to stomp on last access time | Path | |

#### Run it with `sh`!
```
touch -a -t 197001010000.00 #{target_filename}

```
<br/>
<br/>

## Atomic Test #2 - Set a file's modification timestamp
Stomps on the modification timestamp of a file

**Supported Platforms:** linux, macos


#### Inputs
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|-------------------------------------------|
    | target_filename | Path of file that we are going to stomp on last access time | Path | |

#### Run it with `sh`!
```
touch -m -t 197001010000.00 #{target_filename}

```
<br/>
<br/>

## Atomic Test #3 - Set a file's creation timestamp
Stomps on the create timestamp of a file

Setting the creation timestamp requires changing the system clock and reverting.
Sudo or root privileges are required to change date. Use with caution.

**Supported Platforms:** linux, macos


#### Inputs
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|-------------------------------------------|
    | target_filename | Path of file that we are going to stomp on last access time | Path | |

#### Run it with `sh`!
```
NOW=$(date)
date -s "1970-01-01 00:00:00"
touch #{target_filename}
date -s "$NOW"
stat #{target_filename}

```
